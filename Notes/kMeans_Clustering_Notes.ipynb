This is a different way of looking at the same objective. Denote $a_{x_i}$ as the *average* distance from $x_i$ to all other points within its own cluster $k$. The lower the value, the better. On the other hand $b_{x_i}$ is the minimum average distance from $x_i$ to points in a different cluster, minimized over clusters. That is, compute separately for each cluster the average distance from $x_i$ to the points within that cluster, and then take the minimum. The silhouette $s(x_i)$ is defined as\n",
