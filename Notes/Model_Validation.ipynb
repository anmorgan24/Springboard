    "Without proper validation, the results of running new data through a model might not be as accurate as expected. Model validation allows analysts to confidently answer the question, how good is your model? Goal: cover the basics of model validation, discuss various validation techniques, and begin to develop tools for creating validated and high performing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Validation** consists of various steps and processes that ensure your model performs as expected on new data. The most common way to do this is to test your model's accuracy (or, insert evaluation metric of your choice) on data it has never seen before (called a **holdout set**). If your model's accuracy is similar for the data it was trained on and the holdout data. You can claim that your model is validated. The ultimate goal of model validation is to end up with the best performing model possible that achieves high accuracy on new data. \n",

    "    * **`random_state`:** random seed; allows us to create reproducible models\n",
    "* The most common way to set model parameters is to do so when initiating the model\n",
