    "* **Cosine similarity is a metric used to determine how similar the documents are irrespective of their size.**\n",
    "* A commonly used approach to match similar documents is based on counting the maximum number of common words between the documents. But this approach has an inherent flaw. That is, as the size of the document increases, the number of common words tend to increase even if the documents talk about different topics. The cosine similarity helps overcome this fundamental flaw in the ‘count-the-common-words’ or Euclidean distance approach.\n",
    "* Mathematically, cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. In this context, the two vectors are arrays containing the word counts of two documents.\n",
    "* When plotted on a multi-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a word in the document, the cosine similarity captures the orientation (the angle) of the documents and not the magnitude. If you want the magnitude, compute the Euclidean distance instead.\n",
    "* The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance because of the size (like, the word ‘cricket’ appeared 50 times in one document and 10 times in another) they could still have a smaller angle between them. Smaller the angle, higher the similarity.\n",
    "* the closer the documents are by angle, the higher is the Cosine Similarity (Cos theta).\n",
    "* As you include more words from the document, it’s harder to visualize a higher dimensional space. But you can directly compute the cosine similarity using the same math formula."
