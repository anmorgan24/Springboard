    "__Object-oriented programming (OOP)__ is a widely used programming paradigm that reduces development times— making it easier to read, reuse, and maintain your code. OOP shifts the focus from thinking about code as a sequence of actions to looking at your program as a collection of objects that interact with each other. In this course, you’ll learn how to create classes, which act as the blueprints for every object in Python. You’ll then leverage principles called inheritance and polymorphism to reuse and optimize code. Dive in and learn how to create beautiful code that’s clean and efficient!"

    "### Naming conventions: pseudoprivate attributes\n",
    "- Another naming convention is using a leading double underscore. Attributes and methods whose names start with a double underscore are the closest thing Python has to \"private\" fields and methods of other programming languages.\n",
    "#### `obj.__attr_name`, `obj.__method_name()`\n",
    "- Starts but doesn't end with `__` $\\Rightarrow$ \"private\"\n",
    "- Data is not inheritted (at least not in a way that you're used to)\n",
    "    - Python implements **name mangling:** any name starting with a double undersore will automatically prepended by the name of the class when interpretted by Python and that new name will be the actual internal name of the attribute of method\n",
    "    - **`obj.__attr_name`** is interpreted as **`obj._MyClass__attr_name`**\n",
    "- The main use of these pseudo-private attributes is to prevent name clashes in child classes: you can't control what attributes or methods someone will introduce when inheriting from your class, and it's possible that someone will unknowingly introduce a name that already existes in your class, thus overriding the parent method or attribute!\n",
    "- **You can use double leading underscores to protect important attributes and methods that should not be overwritten.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Be careful: leading AND trailing `__` are only used for built-in Python methods (`__init__()`, `__repr__()`)!***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attribute naming conventions\n",
    "In Python, all data is public. Instead of access modifiers common in languages like Java, Python uses naming conventions to communicate the developer's intention to class users, shifting the responsibility of safe class use onto the class user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses underscores extensively to signal the purpose of methods and attributes. In this exercise, you will match a use case with the appropriate naming convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "- **`_name`**: A helper method that checks validity of an attributes value but isn't considered a part of class's public interface\n",
    "- **`__name`**: A 'version' attribute that stores the current version of the class and shouldn't be passed to the child classes, who will have their own versions.\n",
    "- **`__name__`**: A method that is run whenever the object is printed. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise: Using internal attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll return to the `BetterDate` class of Chapter 2. Your date class is better because it will use the sensible convention of having exactly 30 days in each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "You decide to add a method that checks the validity of the date, but you don't want to make it a part of `BetterDate`'s public interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `BetterDate` is available in the script pane."
