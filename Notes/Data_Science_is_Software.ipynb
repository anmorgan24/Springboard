    "This tutorial provides vital developer lifehacks for the working Jupyter data scientist. You’ll learn the basics of writing good software, which will prepare you to be a valuable contributor to your company’s wider engineering organization. You’ll learn the following topics:\n",
    "   * How to effectively structure your project, using the `cookiecutter-datascience` package\n",
    "   * How to **set up a virtual environment**, allowing you to abstract the current project you’re working from your other projects\n",
    "   * How to use a Linux tool called **“make” to create automating parts of your project easier**\n",
    "   * How to **better write your code, so it’s reproducible**, meaning you can come back to a project six months later and easily figure out all the things you’ve done\n",
    "   * How to **modularize your code into packages** so you don’t end up writing the same things repeatedly\n"
