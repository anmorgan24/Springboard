    "**Intro:** Writing Functions in Python will give you a strong foundation in writing complex and beautiful functions so that you can contribute research and engineering skills to your team. You'll learn useful tricks, like how to write context managers and decorators. You'll also learn best practices around how to write maintainable reusable functions with good documentation. They say that people who can do good research and write high-quality code are unicorns. "
