    "* 1) Define a function\n",
    "* 2) (optional) Add any set-up code your context needs\n",
    "* 3) Use the \"yield\" keyword (to signal to Python that this is a \"special\" kind of function\n",
    "* 4) (optional) Add any teardown code your context needs (to clean up the context)\n",

    "    * When you write this word, it means that you are going to return a value but you expect to finish the rest of the function at some point in the future\n",
    "    * The value that your contet manager yields can be assigned to a variable in the with statement by adding `as <variable-name>`\n",
    "    * \"yield\" is used when creating generators\n",
    "    * a context manager function *is* technically a generator that yields a single value\n",
    "    * The ability for a function to yield control and know that it will get to finish running later is what makes context managers so useful. \n",
    "    * Most context managers also have some teardown or cleanup code when they get control back after yielding. \n",
    "    * This setup/teardown behavior allows a context manager to hide things like connecting and disconnecting from a database so that a programmer using the context manager can just perform operations on the database without worrying about the underlying details.\n",
    "    * Some context managers don't yield an explicit value. \n",
    "    * `in_dir()` is a context manager that changes the current working directory to a specific path and then changes it back after the context block is done. \n",
