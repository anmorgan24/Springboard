    "* In this subunit, we'll cover more about image segmentation: one of the most fundamental and studied topics in image processing. \n",
    "* The goal of **segmentation** is to partition images into regions, or segments, to simplify and/or change the representation into something more meaningful and easier to analyze.\n",
    "* For example, **before a tumor is analyzed** in a computed tomography, **it has to be detected and somehow isolated from the rest of the image.**\n",
    "    * Or, **before recognizing a face**, it has to also be **picked out from its background.**\n",
    "* Previously we learned about **Thresholding**, which is the **simplest method of segmentation**, separating foreground from background (kind of... agree to disagree).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Image representation\n",
    "* Consider how we represent images; they are represented as a grid of pixels.\n",
    "* The issue is that they're not a completely natural representation of an image.\n",
    "* If you were to isolate a single pixel from an image, would you be able to tell that the pixel came from a particular image and that this single pixel holds a logical meaning. \n",
    "* **A single pixel, by itself, is not a natural representation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Superpixels\n",
    "* **We can explore more logical meanings in an image that's formed by bigger regions or grouped pixels** (than single pixels on their own). These are known as **superpixels.**\n",
    "* A **superpixel** is a **group of connected pixels with similar colors or gray levels.**\n",
    "    * These carry more meaning than their simple pixel grid counterparts.\n",
    "* **Superpixel segmentation** is dividing an image into superpixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of superpixels\n",
    "* **Superpixel segmentation** is dividing an image into superpixels.\n",
    "* **Superpixel segmentation** has been applied to many computer vision tasks, like **visual tracking** and **image classification**.\n",
    "* Some advantages for using superpixels are:\n",
    "    * More meaningful regions\n",
    "    * Computational efficiency\n",
    "        * Reduce an image from thousands of pixels down to some regions for subsequent algorithms, so you have computational efficiency.\n",
    "        \n",
    "## Segmentation\n",
    "* Two types of segmentation are:\n",
    "    * **1) Supervised:** where some prior knowledge is used to guide the algorithm. \n",
    "        * Example: the kind of thresholding in which we specify the threshold value ourselves.\n",
    "    * **2) Unsupervised:** where no prior knowledge is required. \n",
    "        * These algorithms try to subdivide images into meaningful regions automatically.\n",
    "        * The user may still be able to tweak certain settings to obtain the desired output. \n",
    "        * Example: Otsu thresholding\n",
