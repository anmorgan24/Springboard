    "1) Read error message\n",
    "\n",
    "2) `print()`\n",

    "3) Make a hypothesis: \n",
    "   * When you know the expected results\n",
    "   * When you have some reproducible way of checking whether your program executes correctly\n",
    "   * Test/check could be manual or automatic\n",
    "   * **Important:** Keep some sort of notes to describe what the problem actually is\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Talk to someone (rubber duck debugging)\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Clean up code \n",
