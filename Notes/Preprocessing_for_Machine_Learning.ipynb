    "* One of the first steps you can take to preprocess your data is to remove missing data\n",

    "* Holding out a test set allows us to preserve some data the model hasn't seen yet. \n",
    "* In many scenarios, the default splitting parameters of `train_test_split()` will work well. However, if your labels have an uneven distribution, your test and training sets might not be representative samples of your dataset and could bias the model you're trying to train.\n",
