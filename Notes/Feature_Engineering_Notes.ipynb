    "* Data scientists regularly work with categorical, text, and image data. However, to execute machine learning algorithms on these data types, it's necessary to perform transformations first. \n",
    "* Categorical data, such as the neighborhood in which a property is located, does not always work well with the machine learning algorithm you're most interested in using. \n",
    "* Linear regression, for example, requires numerical inputs.\n",
    "* Options include one-hot encoding of categorical data and text and image data feature engineering (important for processes like NLP, which has applications in social media and data mining).\n",
    "* Featuer engineering with images can be very complex: the simplest of which is just using the pixel values themselves\n",
