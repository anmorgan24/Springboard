    "#### Unix timestamp:\n",
    "* Many computers store datetime information \"behind the scenes\" as the number of seconds since January 1st, 1970. This date is largely considered the birth of modern-style computers.\n",
    "* This is especially common with computer infrastructure, like the log files that websites keep when they get visitors.\n",
    "* The largest number that some older computers can hold in one variable is 2147483648, which as a Unix timestamp is in January 2038. On that day, many computers which haven't been upgraded will fail.\n",
    "* to read a unix timestamp: `print(datetime.fromtimestamp(ts))`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Durations and timedeltas:\n",
    "* Just as dates have \"timedeltas,\" datetimes have \"durations.\" Because datetimes have both date and time, \"durations\" are slightly more complicated.\n",

    "* can be negative\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UTC offsets\n",
    "* datetimes without timezones are referred to as \"naive\" and can't be compared across different parts the world.\n",
    "* Because the UK was the first to standardize its time, everyone in the world sets their clock relative to the original, historical, UK standard. \n",
    "* __UTC:__ UK standard time; because all clocks are set relative to UTC, we can compare time around the world (UTC-x or UTC+x); for example New England is UTC-5hrs\n",
    "* Create a timezone object, which accepts a timedelta that explains how to translate your datetime into UTC:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# US Eastern Standard time zone\n",
    "ET = timezone(timedelta(hours=-5))\n",
    "# Timezone-aware datetime (specify what time zone the clock was in when time was specified):\n",
    "dt = datetime(2017, 12, 30, 15, 9, 3, tzinfo = ET)\n",
    "# Now if you print it, your datetime contains includes your UTC offset\n",
    "print(dt)\n",
    "# outputs: '2017-12-30 15:09:03-5:00'\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Making the datetime aware of its timezone, means you can ask Python new questions (for example, what is this ET time in India Standard Time?) `print(dt.astimezone(IST))`\n",
    "* *Important difference between adjusting timezones and changing tzinfo:*\n",
    "* Changing tzinfo: `print(dt.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc))`: the clock stays the same, but the UTC offset has been shifted only\n",
    "* Adjusting timezones: `print(dt.astimezone(timezone.utc))`; changes **both** UTC offset and the clock itself\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Timezone database\n",
    "* Nearly impossible to know all UTC offsets when you need to align your data to a particular UTC, so instead: `tz` database\n",
    "* `import dateutil` or `from dateutil import tz`\n",
    "* __`tz` database:__\n",
    "    * Format: 'Continent/City' ; `et = tz.gettz('America/New_York')`\n",
    "    * Includes international and *historical* timezones\n",
    "    * Updates automatically for daylight savings, etc\n",
    "    * Full list of tz timezones [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Daylight Savings\n",
    "* to fix problems with comparing datetimes *by hand*, we start by creating timezone objects:\n",
    "    * `EST = timezone(timedelta(hours=-5))` #setting timezone \"by hand\"; Eastern *Standard* Time\n",
    "    * `EDT = timezone(timedelta(hours=-4))` #Eastern *Daylight* Time\n",
    "* to know correct timezone at a given time of year, without having to look it up and set by hand (as above):\n",
    "    * `dateutil` automatically identifies and factors in Daylight Savings Time (and/or other timezone updates)\n",
    "    * `start = datetime(2017, 3, 12, tzinfo = tz.gettz('America/New_York'))`\n",
    "```\n",
    "# How many hours have elapsed? (in hours, regardless of daylight savings)\n",
    "print((end - start).total_seconds()/(60*60))\n",
    "####\n",
    "# set as UTC before calculations to account for daylight savings:\n",
    "print((end.astimezone(timezone.utc) - start.astimezone(timezone.utc)).total_seconds()/(60*60))\n",

    "* wrinkle in time from fall back:\n",
    "    * `tz.datetime_ambiguous(first_1am)`\n",

    "second_1am = datetime(2017, 11, 5, 1, 0, 0, tzinfo = eastern)\n",
    "second_1am = tz.enfold(second_1am)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* `.enfold()` says \"this datetime belongs to the second time the wall clock struck 1am on this day, and not the first\n",
    "* enfold by itself doesn't change any behavior of a datetime `(first_1am - second_1am).total_seconds()` = 0.0\n",
    "* **still need to convert to UTC, which is unambiguous**\n",
    "\n",

    "  # Rides with ambiguous start\n",
    "  if tz.datetime_ambiguous(trip['start']):\n",

    "    * `rides['Duration'].dt.total_seconds.head(5)` #converts duration (timedeltas) to seconds\n",
    "* `.value_counts()`: returns how many times a given value appears\n",
    "* `.groupby()`: group by values in any column; groupby takes a column name and does all subsequent options on each group. Groupby is not limited to daatetime-specific values. For example: group by member type and return mean duration in seconds of bike trips per each member type:\n",
    "    * `rides.groupby('Member type')['Duration seconds'].mean()`\n",
    "* `.resample()`: takes a unit of time, (for example 'M' for month) and a datetime column to group on; specifically, `.resample()` groups rows by some time or date information.\n",
    "    * group rides by time \n",
    "    * `rides.resample('M', on = 'Start date')['Duration seconds'].mean()\n",
    "* Other common groupby combos for datetimes:\n",

    "* `.groupby()` and `.resample()` together:\n",
    "    * `grouped = rides.groupby('Member type').resample('M', on='Start date')`\n",
    "* Just as in Python, **in pandas, all datetimes start off as timezone naive** (not tied to any absolute time with a UTC offset).\n",
    "* **put into a timezone in pandas:**\n",
    "    * `.dt.tz_localize('America/New_York')\n",
    "* **pandas AmbiguousTimeError**: if you try to convert a datetime (or a column of datetimes) that occur during Daylight Savings Time. Alternatively, reset/fill ambiguous times:\n",
    "    * `dt.tz_localize('America/New_York', ambiguous = 'NaT')` \n",
    "    * pandas will skip over NaTs when it sees them: allows you to use .min, .sum, etc functions without error\n",
