    "* Decision trees are supervised learning models used for problems involving classification and regression. \n",
    "* Tree models present a high flexibility that comes at a price: on one hand, trees are able to capture complex non-linear relationships; on the other hand, they are prone to memorizing the noise present in a dataset. \n",
    "* By aggregating the predictions of trees that are trained differently, ensemble methods take advantage of the flexibility of trees while reducing their tendency to memorize noise. \n",
    "* Ensemble methods are used across a variety of fields and have a proven track record of winning many machine learning competitions. \n",
