    "# DataCamp's Winning a Kaggle Competition in Python\n",
    "Kaggle is the most famous platform for Data Science competitions. Taking part in such competitions allows you to work with real-world datasets, explore various machine learning problems, compete with other participants and, finally, get invaluable hands-on experience. In this course, you will learn how to approach and structure any Data Science competition. You will be able to select the correct local validation scheme and to avoid overfitting. Moreover, you will master advanced feature engineering together with model ensembling approaches. All these techniques will be practiced on Kaggle competitions datasets.\n",
