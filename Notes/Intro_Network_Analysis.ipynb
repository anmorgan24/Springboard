    "* Metadata can be stored on the graph as well\n",
    "* For example, add to the node 1, a 'label' key with the value 'blue', just as we would assign a value to the key of a dictionary.\n",
    "* We can then retrieve the node list **with the metadata attached** using `G.nodes()`, passing in the **`data=True`** argument\n",
