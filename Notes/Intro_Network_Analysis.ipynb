    "From online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter to transportation networks such as bike sharing systems, networks are everywhereâ€”and knowing how to analyze them will open up a new world of possibilities for you as a data scientist. This course will equip you with the skills to analyze, visualize, and make sense of networks. You'll apply the concepts you learn to real-world network data using the powerful NetworkX library. With the knowledge gained in this course, you'll develop your network thinking skills and be able to look at your data with a fresh perspective."

    "        * models the relationships between people\n",
    "    * Transportation networks\n",
    "        * models the connectivity between locations, as determined by roads or flight paths connecting them\n",
    "* At their core, **networks are a useful tool for modeling relationships between entities.**\n",
    "* By modeling your data as a network, you can end up gaining insight into what entities (or nodes) are important, such as broadcasters or influencers in a social network.\n",
    "* **Insights:**\n",
    "    * **Important entities:** influencers in social network\n",
    "    * **Pathfinding:** most efficient transport path\n",
    "    * **Clustering:** finding communities\n",

    "* Networks are described by two sets of items: \n",
    "    * **Nodes**\n",
    "    * **Edges**\n",
    "* Together, these form a \"network,\" otherwise known in mathematical terms as a \"graph.\"\n",
    "* Nodes and edges can have metadata associated with them.\n",
    "* In the Python world, there is a library called NetworkX that allows us to manipulate, analyze, and model graph data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NetworkX API Basics\n",
    "* Using `nx.Graph()`, we can initialize an empty graph to which we can nodes and edges\n",
    "* We can add, for example, the integers 1, 2, and 3 as nodes, using the `.add_nodes_from()` method and passing in the list `[1, 2, 3]` as an argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import networkx as nx\n",
    "G = nx.Graph()\n",
    "G.add_nodes_from([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "G.nodes()\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Output:\n",
    "* `[1, 2, 3]`\n",
    "* The Graph object G has a `.nodes()` method that allows us to see what nodes are present in the graph, and returns a list of nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "G.add_edge(1,2)\n",
    "G.edges()\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Output:\n",
    "* `[(1, 2)]`\n",
    "* If we add an edge between the nodes 1 and 2, we can then use the `G.edges()` method to return a list of tuples which represent the edges, in which each tuple shows the nodes that are present on that edges.\n",
    "* Metadata can be stored on the graph as well\n",
    "* For example, add to the node 1, a 'label' key with the value 'blue', just as we would assign a value to the key of a dictionary.\n",
    "* We can then retrieve the node list **with the metadata attached** using `G.nodes()`, passing in the **`data=True`** argument\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "G.node[1]['label'] = 'blue'\n",
    "G.nodes(data=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Outputs:\n",
    "* `[(1, {'label': 'blue'}), (2, {}), (3, {})]`\n",
    "* This returns a list of 2-tuples, in which the first element of each tuple is the node, and the second element is a dictionary in which the key-value pairs correspond to my metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NetworkX** also provides basic drawing functionality, using the `nx.draw()` function, which takes in a Graph, `G` as an argument.\n",
