    "\n",
    "#### NetworkX API Basics\n",
    "* Using `nx.Graph()`, we can initialize an empty graph to which we can nodes and edges\n",

    "G.nodes()\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Output:\n",
    "* `[1, 2, 3]`\n",

    "G.edges()\n",

    "* Metadata can be stored on the graph as well\n",
    "* For example, add to the node 1, a 'label' key with the value 'blue', just as we would assign a value to the key of a dictionary.\n",
    "* We can then retrieve the node list **with the metadata attached** using `G.nodes()`, passing in the **`data=True`** argument\n",
